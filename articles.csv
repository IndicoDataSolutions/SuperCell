"Brazil hit by more punches amid historic recessionBrazil's problems keep piling up.Amid its historic recession, things are getting worse for many Brazilians since an impeachment trial began last May against former President Dilma Rousseff, who was forced to step down in late August. About 12 million Brazilians are now out of work, up from 8.8 million a year ago, recent government figures show. On Tuesday, officials announced that Brazil's industrial production declined so much in August, it wiped out the gains from the past five months. The International Monetary Fund gave a rough assessment of Brazil as well on Tuesday. ""Confidence appears to have bottomed out in Brazil,"" IMF economists wrote in their World Economic Outlook. ""Policy credibility has been severely dented by events leading up to the regime change."" Brazil is mired in in its longest recession since the 1930s and the IMF estimates meager growth next year. Latin America's largest economy shrank 3.8% last year and the IMF now forecasts it will fall another 3.3% this year. Brazil's job market is in tatters. Wages in Brazil declined 3% in August and the unemployment rate rose to 11.8%, up from 8.7% a year ago. Industrial production in Brazil declined 3.8% in August compared to July, negating five months of improvement. Brazil's new president, Michel Temer, took over in May and brought in a new team of market-friendly leaders to steer the economy out of recession. Not everyone is convinced things are changing quickly enough. ""While the government maintains a market-friendly rhetoric, the pace of reforms have been disappointing,"" says Dan Raghoonundon, a Latin American equity analyst at Janus Capital, a U.S. investment firm. It's also unclear how much Temer will get done with an approval rating of 14%, according to Brazilian polling firm Datafolha. Protesters are already calling for Temer's resignation. Three of his cabinet officials resigned over the summer after they were accused of allegedly accepting bribes. Rousseff, the former president, was impeached for manipulating the country's budget numbers right before an election in 2014. However, a massive bribery scandal at Brazil's state-run oil company, Petrobras, largely triggered the country's severe recession. ""Brexit fears send British pound to new 31-year lowThe British pound slumped to its lowest level in 31 years on Tuesday on fears that the U.K.'s divorce from the European Union will be bad for the economy.The currency fell to just above $1.27, lower even than in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum on June 23, when Brits voted to take their country out of the 28-member group. Brexit plans have begun to emerge in the last few days: talks with the EU will begin in early 2017, the exit will happen two years later, and the U.K. will give priority to controlling immigration. European leaders have made clear that if Britain does not allow free movement of EU citizens across its borders, it will lose some of its rights to access the free trade area. So investors are worrying again about two big issues: British exporters may find it harder to compete in Europe, and the country's banks could lose the ability to do business freely across the region. Thousands of financial firms in the U.K. currently have ""passports"" that allow them to trade in Europe without establishing subsidiaries in each country. And those businesses are vital for Britain: the financial and related services sector accounts for 12% of GDP. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Prime Minister Theresa May would ""refuse to prioritize"" the financial services industry in exit negotiations with the EU. Citing three anonymous government sources, Bloomberg said the sector held far less sway with May than with her predecessor David Cameron. Instead, May now appears to be putting control of Britain's borders first. Brexit campaigners had promised to impose new limits on the number of EU citizens entering the U.K. ""We voted to leave the European Union and become a fully independent, sovereign country,"" the Conservative leader told party members this weekend. ""We are not leaving the European Union today to give up control of immigration again."" Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, said that May appears to be treating immigration as ""the hardest of lines... [that] won't be sacrificed or watered down in order to keep access to the single market, particularly for financial services."" Some investors fear that the strategy will result in a ""hard"" exit from the EU and years of pain for Britain. The U.K. economy has proved more resilient than expected in the wake of the EU referendum, but the sharp fall in the value of the pound and a big injection of money from the Bank of England have helped limit the fallout. Treasury chief Philip Hammond acknowledged Monday that the British economy would pay a price for Brexit. He confirmed that a target to balance the budget by 2020 set by his predecessor would have to be abandoned -- a consequence of Brexit that will add to Britain's £1 trillion-plus debt. The International Monetary Fund added to the gloom on Tuesday, downgrading its July forecast for the U.K. economy. Even in the best case scenario, where fallout from Brexit is limited, the IMF predicts growth to slow to just 1.1% in 2017. The pound has lost fallen than 15% over the past year, and is now trading way below its recent high of $1.71 set just two years ago. Analysts at UBS said the pain is far from over. ""In our view it is only a matter of time before less positive data starts to appear,"" they warned. ""Does India's booming economy really need a rate cut?India cut interest rates Tuesday, citing growing risks to the world's fastest growing major economy.The surprise move by the Reserve Bank of India left some experts worrying that cheaper money could make it harder to bring inflation down. The RBI cut rates to 6.25%, their lowest level in nearly six years. India's economy grew by just over 7% in the quarter to June. That was slower than the previous quarter, but still much faster than China and other leading economies. But the central bank's six-member Monetary Policy Committee, newly instituted under governor Urjit Patel after he took the helm in September, appears to have decided not to take any chances with growth. It warned that the outlook for the economy was darkening due to a slump in global trade, rising protectionism, banking stress in Europe and the risks associated with Britain's exit from the European Union. At the same time, inflation -- it argued -- was under control, and would be helped by a good monsoon season that should result in a record harvest. However, by stoking demand in the economy the central bank could be making it harder to achieve its 4% inflation target. Consumer price inflation stood just above 5% in August. The policy statement ""seems to be supporting growth even at the risk of missing targets for inflation,"" wrote Shilan Shah, India Economist at Capital Economics. He said it suggested that Patel was taking a more ""dovish"" stance on inflation than his ""rock star"" predecessor Raghuram Rajan. ""This suggests that we could see further modest, loosening over the coming months,"" Shah said. ""But the scope for aggressive rate cuts is limited."" ""Theranos cutting hundreds of jobs as it shutters labsEmbattled blood-testing firm Theranos is downsizing.In an open letter to stakeholders, CEO Elizabeth Holmes said the startup is closing its clinical labs and Theranos Wellness Centers. She said the closures would affect 340 employees in Arizona, California and Pennsylvania. Theranos said this summer that it employed between 700 and 900 people. ""We are profoundly grateful to these team members, many of whom have devoted years to Theranos and our mission, for their commitment to our company and our guests,"" she said. The once celebrated startup has suffered a series of heavy setbacks recently. It's under investigation by multiple federal agencies after doubts emerged about its methods. Earlier this year, Holmes was banned from owning or operating a laboratory for two years. The CEO said her company is now returning its attention to its miniLab platform -- a device that can run diagnostic tests on small amounts of blood. ""Our ultimate goal is to commercialize miniaturized, automated laboratories capable of small-volume sample testing,"" Holmes said in the letter. According to Theranos, the miniLab can hold multiple cartridges that can each run up to 40 tests. The amount of blood needed for each varies. Yet experts say the device isn't so revolutionary that it would warrant the $9 billion valuation that Theranos once claimed. Competitors like Quest (DGX) and Siemens (SIEGY) sell devices with similar benefits that are already on the market. Holmes said Wednesday that the company's new executive team is working to obtain clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, build commercial partnerships and publish in scientific journals. In October 2015, the Wall Street Journal published articles calling Theranos' claims and blood testing methods into question. Theranos has continued to contest the allegations against it. The firm, founded by Holmes at age 19, positioned itself as a provider of cheaper, more efficient alternatives to traditional medical tests. It said it could process up to 70 lab tests on just a few drops of blood. The company has faced scrutiny from Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California. Those probes came on top of an inspection by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which later revoked the license of Theranos' California blood-testing facility and imposed the lab ban on Holmes. ""What Note 7 crisis? Samsung stock hits new highSamsung is grappling with a huge and embarrassing recall of one of its flagship smartphones, but its stock just hit a new high. What gives?Samsung (SSNLF) shares trading in Seoul jumped 4.5% on Thursday after an activist hedge fund called for an overhaul of the South Korean company's complicated structure and a special $27 billion payout to shareholders. The U.S. fund, Elliott Management, argues that Samsung's relatively cheap share price could skyrocket if the company's management is willing to make a series of key reforms. Samsung said it will ""carefully review"" the proposals from the hedge fund, which is run by billionaire investor Paul Singer. Problems with Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 smartphone put a big dent in the company's share price last month, wiping tens of billions of dollars off its market value. Concerns mounted after some Note 7 owners reported their phones' batteries had caught fire while charging, and aviation authorities warned people not to use them on board planes. But the stock has bounced back since, with some analysts saying they expect worries about the Note 7 to fade. ""Despite the recent unfortunate events associated with battery cells for the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung Electronics is well-positioned in terms of market share and profitability,"" Elliott Management said in an open letter to Samsung directors. The fund, which said it holds a stake of about 0.6% in Samsung, highlighted the company's strengths across a range of businesses, including mobile phone technology, semiconductors and consumer electronics. But it argued that Samsung's ""unnecessarily complex"" group structure needs simplifying and its ""subpar"" corporate governance should be improved. Samsung is South Korea's largest ""chaebol,"" a type of family-run business group that plays a big role in the country's economy. Last year, shareholders gave the green light to a controversial merger between two Samsung affiliates that would help ailing chairman Lee Kun-hee pass control of the conglomerate to his son, Lee Jae-yong. That's the kind of thing Elliott says needs to be done differently. The Lee family would keep its controlling interest under the hedge fund's plan, but it calls for the introduction at least three ""truly independent"" directors at board level. ""We see this as a defining moment and a tremendous opportunity for the forthcoming new leadership of Samsung Electronics to further advance the company's remarkable legacy,"" it said. Samsung shares are notoriously difficult to purchase for individual U.S. investors. One of the reforms proposed by Elliott Management is a new listing on the Nasdaq. "
